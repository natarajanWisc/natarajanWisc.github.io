			<h2>About Soil Degradation</h2>
			<p>Soil Degradation is a massive issue in the world today. An aricle titled, <i>Relationship Between Physical-geographical Factors and Soil Degradation on Agricultural Land,</i> by Bednar et al. states that at least 33% of Earth’s
				surface has been affected by soil degradation. Essentially, this means that more than a 1/3 of the entire surface of the Earth has been negatively effected due to the loss of equilibrium of a stable soil. Land degradation 
				has been further defined as, "a negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes," by the report titled <i>Climate Change and Change in Land</i>. This issue has been exasperated by human 
			processes and it is coming to a point where change needs to happen. </p>
