				<h2>About Soil Degradation</h2>
				<p>Soil Degradation is a massive issue in the world today. To put simply, soil 
					degradation is the chemical, physical, and biological decline of soil overtime.
					Whether it be the loss of organic matter or the decline of soil biodiversity, 
					the process is destroying our planet. Soil is the key to all life on Earth; 
					an essential medium that allows life to flourish and grow. Recent data, however,
					 has been illustrating our soil is not what it used to be.
					An aricle titled,
					<i>Relationship Between Physical-geographical Factors and Soil Degradation
						on Agricultural Land,</i> by Bednar et al. states that at least 33% of
					Earth’s
					surface has been affected by soil degradation. Essentially, this means that
					more than a 1/3 of the entire surface of the Earth has been negatively
					effected due to the loss of equilibrium in stable soil. Land degradation
					has been further defined as, "a negative trend in land condition, caused by
					human-induced processes," in a report titled <i>Climate
					Change and Change in Land</i>. This issue has been exasperated by human
					processes and it is coming to a point where change needs to happen. The image below 
					shows soil that has been degraded overtime. It is obvious to see that the soil in the image 
					is not fit for organisms to live on. There is a clear lack of nutrients which make it 
					inadequate for argicultural use.

				<h2>Causes of Soil Degradation</h2>
				<p>There has been direct and indirect human-induced processes that have
					caused soil degradation. Human activities such as intensive agriculture, 
					overgrazing, deforestation, and the use of pesticides/fertilizers contribute 
					to soil degradation. These processes decrease organic matter content, nutrient availability,
					and water retention capacity in the soil. Specifically, one of the most challenging issues 
					in this topic is soil desertification. More about the effects of this phenomenon 
					in the next section.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					There are other causes to soil degradation as well. Agricultural activities
					often depletes soil of important organic matter which then causes nutrient
					contents of foods produced by that soil to be low.
					The EU has done research on this topic and they found that, in Europe
					alone, 2.5 million locations have contaminated soil. Of that 2.5 million
					342,000 locations needs immediate revision attention to improve soil health
					(Bednar 3).
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>To say soil degradation is a hurdle in today's society is an understatement. Below 
					we have included an image which shows a cause and effect graph of soil degradation. Practices 
					such as population growth drives us to use more Earth's land for agriculture. Some agriculture 
					practices cause for soil organic carbon loss and soil nurtient imbalance.

			<section id="effects">
				<h2>Effects of Soil Degradation</h2>
				<p>One of the biggest effects caused by soil degradation is the concept of
					soil desertification, as mentioned in the previous section. The IPCC 
					(Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) defines desertification as 
					land degradation to drylands, mostly reuslting from
					climate change and human activities. The increasing global temperature
					leads to more droughts, and these droughts deplete the soil's water content
					and deprive
					it of important nutrients. The soil top layer becomes dry which makes it
					susceptible to erosion. Not only increased temperature is causing issues,
					but also extreme weather. The WHO (World Health Organization) published the
					article
					<i>Climate change: Land degradation and desertification</i> which noted
					that extreme weather caused by climate change causes increased levels of
					erosion in these areas. The high temperature makes the soil more fragile,
					and then extreme
					weather conditions break up the already sensitive soil. The positive
					feedback loop is damaging our environment.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					According to <i>Restoring Soil Quality to Mitigate Soil Degradation” by Lat
						et. al.</i>, soil desertification, itself has other effects too. This
					includes water pollution and contamination that can have an effect on
					metropolitan cities.
					Soil desertification not only erodes the soil but also impacts its quality
					which is what causes the water to also get contaminated. This will not only
					affect the environment but also us humans as this is a phenomenon present
					in developing countries. Soil desertification, the loss of soil productivity
					in drylands, is a particularly concerning consequence of soil degradation.
				</p>
				<br>
				<p>
					Soil degradation also leads to effects in human health. When soil is degraded, 
					nutrients are lost (due to argicultural practices that use pesticides). Food that 
					has been harvested from the soil lacking the proper nutrients causes the nutritional 
					value of said foods to decrease signficantly. Topsoil with high levels of carbon is the main 
					conntributing factor that gives food its nutritional value. When the precious topsoil is eroded 
					the nutritional value is lost. Therefore the food that we grow in this topsoil is depleted 
					of much needed nutrients. Food waste also contributes to soil degradation. Food that goes into 
					landfills prevents nutrients from being recycled back into the soils. Again, this creates a postive 
					feedback loop; effectively continuing the deletion (University of Massachusetts-Amherst- 1).

				<h2>Solutions to Soil Degradation</h2>
				<p>One of the most effective ways to solve this issue is to simply talk about it. 
					Communicating and bringing
					awareness about the issue of soil degradation can be a vital step towards
					finding a solution. Through education and awareness, individuals and
					communities can understand the causes and effects of soil degradation are and
					what action can be taken to prevent it.

					We choose to play our part through this
					very blog because haivng information about this topic on thee web
				   allows more people to be aware of it.
