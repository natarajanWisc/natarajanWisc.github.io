			<h2>About Soil Degradation</h2>
			<p>Soil Degradation is a massive issue in the world today. An aricle titled, <i>Relationship Between Physical-geographical Factors and Soil Degradation on Agricultural Land,</i> by Bednar et al. states that at least 33% of Earth’s
				surface has been affected by soil degradation. Essentially, this means that more than a 1/3 of the entire surface of the Earth has been negatively effected due to the loss of equilibrium of a stable soil. Land degradation 
				has been further defined as, "a negative trend in land condition, caused by direct or indirect human-induced processes," by the report titled <i>Climate Change and Change in Land</i>. This issue has been exasperated by human
				processes and it is coming to a point where change needs to happen.

			<h2>Causes of Soil Degradation</h2>
			<p>There has been direct and indirect human-induced processes that have caused soil degradation. One of the most challenges issues in this topic is soil desertification. The IPCC (Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change) defines
				desertification as land degradation to drylands, mostly reuslting from climate change and human activities. The increasing global temperature leads to more droughts, and these droughts deplete the soil's water content and deprive
				it of important nutrients. The soil toplayer becomes dry which makes it susceptible to erosion. Not only increased temperature is causing issues, but also extreme weather. The WHO (World Health Organization) published the article
			<i>Climate change: Land degradation and desertification</i> which noted that extreme weather caused by climate change causes increased levels of erosion in these areas. The high temperature makes the soil more fragile, and then extreme 
				weather conditions break up the already sensitive soil. The positive feedback loop is damaging our environment.
			</p>

				There are other causes to soil degradation as well. Agricultural activities often depletes soil of important organic matter which then causes nutrient contents of foods produced by that soil to be low.
				The EU has done research on this topic and they found that, in Europe alone, 2.5 million locatoins have contaminated soil. Of that 2.5 million 342,000 locations needs immediate revision attention to improve soil health (Bednar 3).

			<h2>Effects of Soil Degradation</h2>
			<p>One of the biggest effects caused by soil degradation is the concept of soil desertification. This, as defined by the IPCC is the land degradation to drylands. Our actions that cause climate change result in draughts, and this lack
				of water causes erosion. This has resulted in a significant spike in the amount of drylands. When the soil does not have the right nutrients, this results in the topsoil being drier and more vulnerable to erosion. This is also 
				aided by the increase in more extreme weather phenomenon that is, once again, caused by climate change. (<i>“Climate change: Land degradation and desertification” published by the World Health Organization in 2020</i>)
